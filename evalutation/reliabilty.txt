how reliable is the connection:

position fixed: we couldnt detect any losses 100%

riding a bike: same as position fixed 100%

doesnt matter if app is running in the forground or background



how reliable is the reconnection:

app is running in the forground: 100%

app is running in the background/on pause: 50%
